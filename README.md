# Python Courses

This repo will contains all codes i've made in the proccess of learning Python.  

The main source will be [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ "freeCodeCamp Official Website"). If any other resource is used, its details will be listed in its own section.

## Scientific Computing with Python | Python for Everybody Course
Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.

Python for everybody is a free video course series that teaches the basics of using Python 3.

The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and web development.

### Conditionals
- Exercise 1: Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

- Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program.

- Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
  |Score|Grade |
  |:-:|:-:|
  |>= 0.9|A|
  |>= 0.8|B|
  |>= 0.7|C|
  |>= 0.6|D|
  |< 0.6|F|

### Functions
- Exercise 6: Rewrite your pay computation with time-and-a-half for overtime and create a function called computepay which takes two parameters (hours and rate)

- Exercise 7: Rewrite the grade program from the previous chapter using a function called computegrade that takes a score as its parameter and returns a grade as a string

### Loops and Iterations
- Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done". Once "done" is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.

- Exercise 2: Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.
