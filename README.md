## Scientific Computing with Python | Python for Everybody Course
Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.

Python for everybody is a free video course series that teaches the basics of using Python 3.

The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and web development.

### Conditionals
#### Catching exceptions using try and except
- Exercise 1: Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

- Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program.

- Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
  |Score|Grade |
  |:-:|:-:|
  |>= 0.9|A|
  |>= 0.8|B|
  |>= 0.7|C|
  |>= 0.6|D|
  |< 0.6|F|
